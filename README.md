# RUForHire
This project is about building an easy job search solution. The idea is to aggregate job postings from various sources and build a system on top of it where users can upload their resume for job recommendations. We plan to extract relevant information from userâ€™s resume or Linkedin profile and use it to provide a list of jobs ranked by relevance.
